# Vacuum Cleaner Pathfinding Simulation

This project simulates a vacuum cleaner agent navigating a grid environment to clean dirty spots using various pathfinding algorithms, including A* (Manhattan & Euclidean), Greedy Search, BFS, DFS, UCS, and custom movement heuristics like StayLeft and StayUp. The goal is to analyze how these algorithms impact efficiency in terms of nodes explored, path length, and execution time.

## Overview
This project is a Python-based simulation where an autonomous vacuum cleaner moves through a grid to clean dirt. The vacuum cleaner follows an optimal path determined by different search algorithms, each affecting the agent's efficiency and movement strategy:

- **A* (Manhattan & Euclidean Heuristics)**: Evaluates paths using cost functions to optimize movement.
- **Greedy Best-First Search**: Prioritizes movement toward the goal but may ignore optimal paths.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Expands nodes evenly layer by layer, ensuring shortest paths for uniform-cost scenarios.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as deep as possible before backtracking, which may result in suboptimal paths.
- **Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)**: Expands the lowest-cost node first, ensuring optimality for varying path costs.
- **StayLeft & StayUp Movement**: Custom heuristics where the vacuum prioritizes moving left or up when paths are ambiguous.
